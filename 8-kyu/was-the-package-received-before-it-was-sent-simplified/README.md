The delivery takes <strong>duration</strong> hours to complete (integer between 0 to 24, inclusive).</p><h3 id="examples">Examples</h3><h4 id="eg-1">Eg 1.</h4><p>Given tz_from=3, tz_to=0, start=13, duration=1, return False. A package sent at 13:00 from time zone 3 takes 1 hour to be delivered to time zone 0. The package is received at 11:00 local time, the same day it was sent. Return "False" as it was not received the day before it was sent.</p><h4 id="eg-2">Eg 2.</h4><p>Given tz_from=12, tz_to=-3, start=5, duration=8, return True. A package sent at 05:00 from time zone 12 takes 8 hours to be delivered to time zone -3. The package is received at 22:00 local time, the day before it was sent. Return "True" as it was received the day before it was sent.</p>
